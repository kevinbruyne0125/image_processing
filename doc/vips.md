# ImageProcesing::Vips

The `ImageProcessing::Vips` module contains processing macros that use the
[ruby-vips] gem, which you need to install:

```rb
# Gemfile
gem "ruby-vips", "~> 2.0"
```

Note that you'll need to have [libvips] 8.6 or higher installed; see the
[installation instructions] for more details.

## Methods

#### `.valid_image?`

Returns true if the image is processable, and false if it's corrupted or not
supported by libvips.

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips.valid_image?(normal_image)    #=> true
ImageProcessing::Vips.valid_image?(corrupted_image) #=> false
```

#### `#resize_to_limit`

Downsizes the image to fit within the specified dimensions while retaining the
original aspect ratio. Will only resize the image if it's larger than the
specified dimensions.

```rb
pipeline = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(image) # 600x800

result = pipeline.resize_to_limit!(400, 400)

Vips::Image.new_from_file(result.path).size #=> [300, 400]
```

It's possible to omit one dimension, in which case the image will be resized
only by the provided dimension.

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_limit!(400, nil)
# or
pipeline.resize_to_limit!(nil, 400)
```

Any additional options are forwarded to [`Vips::Image#thumbnail_image`]:

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_limit!(400, 400, linear: true)
```

See [`vips_thumbnail()`] for more details.

#### `#resize_to_fit`

Resizes the image to fit within the specified dimensions while retaining the
original aspect ratio. Will downsize the image if it's larger than the
specified dimensions or upsize if it's smaller.

```rb
pipeline = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(image) # 600x800

result = pipeline.resize_to_fit!(400, 400)

Vips::Image.new_from_file(result.path).size #=> [300, 400]
```

It's possible to omit one dimension, in which case the image will be resized
only by the provided dimension.

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_fit!(400, nil)
# or
pipeline.resize_to_fit!(nil, 400)
```

Any additional options are forwarded to [`Vips::Image#thumbnail_image`]:

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_fit!(400, 400, linear: true)
```

See [`vips_thumbnail()`] for more details.

#### `#resize_to_fill`

Resizes the image to fill the specified dimensions while retaining the original
aspect ratio. If necessary, will crop the image in the larger dimension.

```rb
pipeline = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(image) # 600x800

result = pipeline.resize_to_fill!(400, 400)

Vips::Image.new_from_file(result.path).size #=> [400, 400]
```

Any additional options are forwarded to [`Vips::Image#thumbnail_image`]:

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_fill!(400, 400, crop: :attention) # smart crop
```

See [`vips_thumbnail()`] for more details.

#### `#resize_and_pad`

Resizes the image to fit within the specified dimensions while retaining the
original aspect ratio. If necessary, will pad the remaining area with
transparent color if source image has alpha channel, black otherwise.

```rb
pipeline = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(image) # 600x800

result = pipeline.resize_and_pad!(400, 400)

Vips::Image.new_from_file(result.path).size #=> [400, 400]
```

If you're converting from a format that doesn't support transparent colors
(e.g. JPEG) to a format that does (e.g. PNG), setting `:alpha` to `true` will
add the alpha channel to the image:

```rb
pipeline.resize_and_pad!(400, 400, alpha: true)
```

The `:extend` and `:background` options are also accepted and are forwarded to
[`Vips::Image#gravity`]:

```rb
pipeline.resize_and_pad!(400, 400, extend: :copy)
```

The `:gravity` option can be used to specify the [direction] where the source
image will be positioned (defaults to `"centre"`).

```rb
pipeline.resize_and_pad!(400, 400, gravity: "north-west")
```

Any additional options are forwarded to [`Vips::Image#thumbnail_image`]:

```rb
pipeline.resize_to_fill!(400, 400, linear: true)
```

See [`vips_thumbnail()`] and [`vips_gravity()`] for more details.

#### `#convert`

Specifies the output format.

```rb
pipeline = ImageProcessing::Vips.source(image)

result = pipeline.convert!("png")

File.extname(result.path)
#=> ".png"
```

By default the original format is retained when writing the image to a file. If
the source file doesn't have a file extension, the format will default to JPEG.

#### `#method_missing`

Any unknown methods will be delegated to [`Vips::Image`].

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips
  .crop(0, 0, 300, 300)
  .invert
  .set("icc-profile-data", custom_profile)
  .gaussblur(2)
  # ...
```

#### `#custom`

Yields the intermediary `Vips::Image` object. If the block return value is a
`Vips::Image` object it will be used in further processing, otherwise if `nil`
is returned the original `Vips::Image` object will be used.

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips
  .custom { |image| image + image.invert if invert? }
  # ...
```

### `#loader`

Specifies options that will be forwarded to [`Vips::Image.new_from_file`].

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips
  .loader(access: :sequential)
  # ...
```

See [`vips_jpegload()`], [`vips_pngload()`] etc. for more details on
format-specific load options. Note that `:fail` is set to `true` by default.
Any provided options that are not defined for a specific loader will be ignored.

An additional `:autorot` option is accepted to specify whether
[`vips_autorot()`] should be automatically called after the image is loaded
(defaults to `true`).

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips
  .loader(autorot: false) # disable automatic rotation
  # ...
```

If you would like to have more control over loading, you can load the image
directly using `Vips::Image`, and just pass the `Vips::Image` object as the
source file.

```rb
vips_image = Vips::Image.magickload(file.path, n: -1)

ImageProcessing::Vips
  .source(vips_image)
  # ...
```

#### `#saver`

Specifies options that will be forwarded to [`Vips::Image#write_to_file`].

```rb
ImageProcessing::Vips
  .saver(Q: 100, interlace: true)
```

See [`vips_jpegsave()`], [`vips_pngsave()`] etc. for more details on
format-specific save options. Any provided options that are not defined for a
specific saver will be ignored.

If you would like to have more control over saving, you can call `#call(save:
false)` to get the `Vips::Image` object, and call the saver on it directly.

```rb
vips_image = ImageProcessing::Vips
  .resize_to_limit(400, 400)
  .call(save: false)

vips_image.write_to_file("/path/to/destination", **options)
```
